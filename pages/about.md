## About TTS Office of Acquisitions

The Office of Acquisitions is an office inside the General Services Administration's Technology Transformation Service that helps other federal agencies buy and share efficient and easy-to-use digital services. You can learn more about [what we deliver](https://18f.gsa.gov/what-we-deliver/). We're a team of contracting officers, lawyers, product manager, researchers, strategists, designers, and developers.

### Our state and local work

We work with state and local governments, and we look forward to spreading our impact to all levels of government. Due to the legal authority weÂ use to engage and work with states, we do not build products for our state partners, but we do assist them with product and acquisition strategy and agile coaching.
